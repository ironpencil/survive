Summary

Hey guys, I found a disk with this game on it in my uncle's attic after he passed away. He was a park ranger and apparently the game was used by some state parks agency on their welcoming kiosks to teach young kids how to be safe in the wilderness. I don't know why but I guess they stopped using it shortly after it was put in place.

The basic premise is that you have become lost in the wilderness and must make your way back to the park Visitor Center safely. Along the way you have to deal with typical dangers you would face in the wilderness and answer some questions to earn Wilderness Safety Points or something.

It's a pretty easy game, I've beaten it a few times now, but it feels like there's something off about it. I found a weird message near the visitor center too but I don't know what it's talking about, and supposedly there are a couple different endings but I haven't seen them. I don't know, maybe you guys will have more luck figuring it out than I did.

Also if you feel lost I'd recommend staying mostly on the path to the left from the start, there's a lot of open space (it's the wilderness) but if you stay near the path you won't get lost. It looks like maybe whoever made it was planning on putting more content out there but didn't get it done for some strange reason.
